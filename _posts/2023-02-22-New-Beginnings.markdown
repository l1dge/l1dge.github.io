Someone prompted me this week to restart my blog with the enthusiasm and vigor that I once had<!--more--> but I'm not sure if I really have it in me. So forgive me if this doesn't remain consistent, but I will give it a go. In the past year a lot has changed for me both personally and professionally so I haven't had as much time as I'd have liked to work on side projects, this blog or my own personal health.

One thing is for sure, that now I'm over the hump, I will try and push forward with maintaining this site, my projects and my enthusiasm for all things techie. I shall also be refocussing my efforts, less on social media and more on my projects and this blog.

I have a significant number of projects I'd like to tackle that have been hanging around for a while, starting with the list below:

Retro Computer Refurbs:
- BBC Micro
- Acorn Electron
- Amstrad CPC464
- Commodore 64 (Breadbin)
- Commodore 64c
- Sega Megadrive (Genesis to the rest of the world)

Office Refurb:
- Clear out the crap time!
- Possible remodel, but certainly a tidy up!

Training:
- Learn all the things!

If you're interested in any of the above then please let me know and I may do a blog post about them.

TIL this week:

* I know less than I thought I did
* Learning is a lifetime experience
* I still have so much to learn

It's obviously been a while since I last posted, and there have been considerable changes in my life since then, most notably starting a new job at the beginning of this year, for which the recruitment process was quick, but far from painless, and totally out of the blue but more on that in another post.
