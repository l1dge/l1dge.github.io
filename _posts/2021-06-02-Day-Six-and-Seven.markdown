So we had a nice long holiday weekend here in the UK so I took the advantage, or rather the wife did (Long DIY list goes here), of having a break from the code, apart from a sneaky pybit on Saturday morning it was hands off <!--more-->
this weekend. The sun shone, the pool went up and we enjoyed a lovely BBQ.

Tuesday I spent most of the day coding my django apps views and forms to get some basic functionality, followed by themeing the site using a nice free bootstrap template that just needed massaging into place. Today (Weds 2nd June) I have spent adding some authentication to my site, fixing the navbars and generally learning all about user authentication. 

Bob has just sent me a number of comments for the two PR's I have raised which I'll now review ready for our code clinic tomorrow. Really enjoying this whole process and learning a lot about my coding skills and where I need to brush up on.
