So another slow start to the day. 08:30 arrived at the vacination center with the good lady wife for the 2nd COVID-19 jab so thats both of us all done for a while, starting to feel a bit groggy tonight though so hope thats all the side effects I get. Then it was a race back home <!--more-->for a great code-clinic zoom with Bob, we discussed some really cool things and he helped me fix an issue which was bugging me with my code (turns out skipping sections in the docs isn't a good thing), a simple fix really.  
We then looked at ways of creating dummy db data/ images and Bob came up with a new approach to use Django-Commands. Essentially I came away from the meeting with a reading list as long as your arm and more things to learn, not that I'm complaining, all this knowledge will help for my next project.  
The good thing is that the site is coming along nicely and has made me appreciate the amount of work that must go into some of the sites and apps I use.  

I also learned a new TLA(Three Letter Acronym) today, had to look it up - TIL (Things I Learned) so I thought I'd adopt that into a nice list for you so here goes.

TIL:

- Django-Commands
- Python Faker package
- The websites [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com) and [DummyImage](https://dummyimage.com)
- Django-location-field
- Some doctors and nurses are better at vacinations than others! (But we appreciate you all!)

Goals for the rest of the week are to implement some tests for the site, create some fake data for testing and look into using the django auth model.
  
That should keep me busy for a while at least!! Catch you guys tomorrow. [^1]
