This year I have had a social media reset. No more FaceBook, Twitter(X), Instagram. They are all poison for a healthy mind.
<!--more-->
My only social media presence going forward will be this blog, in some form or another where I have full control over my own content.
I may revisit the platform on which I host my posts but this for the time being is the only place you will find my ramblings.
I do still have a YouTube channel but at the moment it is devoid of any content.

As always you can follow me here:

* [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOdrk4ceynOO9ip9pR-4Mcw)
* [Github](https://github.com/l1dge)


If you are still here thanks for sticking with me, Signing off for today and Happy Coding! See you soon!
