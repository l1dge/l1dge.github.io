Ending this weeks work on a high. Authentication all working, django commands all working, able to start moving forward now with more refined commands and tests. I can safely say I think I now have a very good grasp of the django authentication system and the allauth implementation. I've also got used to using the faker package and the many providers it has to create dummy data for loading the db. I also discovered the [django-truncate](https://pypi.org/project/django-truncate/) plugin which allows you to clear down your django database in a very easy manner. I even had time to write a dummyimage creation script for my testing using opencv, modified from code I found on the web. You can find the script here [dummyimages](https://github.com/l1dge/dummyimages), it'll be very easy to change to suit your own purposes if required. Didn't realise how simple it was to create them. Probably not the most pythonic script but quick and dirty for my purposes whilst I'm still learning.  
  
So next week I have lots to get done, commands to finish, tests to write (yes I haven't forgotten Bob!) and also implement some code change recommendations that we discussed today, remove redundant code and generally have a good tidy up. I

So thats all for tonight folks! Have a great weekend, we get to celebrate Fathers Day on Sunday in the glorious British rain so I might get a day off (**NOT!!**), still can't be as bad as the football this evening!!
