Thirty five days since my last update. Thirty five days!! Thats a lifetime in the world of python development, at least it feels that way. <!--more-->However, I have not been sat on my laurels, rather hard at it finishing off the first app, and making leaps and bounds on the second. Also taking two weeks vacation in the middle of the process! Man that can kill your creative drive, but it had to be done. 
  
TIL in those thirty five days:

* TailwindCSS
* Python Facial Recognition
* More HTML / CSS
* Greater knowledge of Django
* Django AllAuth default Template / Form overriding
* Heroku
* Google Maps and Places API's
* S3 Buckets ACL's
* Chart.js

It's been a whirlwind month but I learned and implemented a lot of things in the new app, had my ups and downs.

We had a wonderful break, buying a campervan on the first day of the holiday and spending the rest of the time out and about exploring the countryside.

But, on return from vacation work got in the way for a few days and eventually after a swift kick up the arse by Bob I continued with the new project, implementing, in record time I may add, a facial recognition test as part of future app development. A short demo to Bob during our final code-clinic of PDM, which went very well, and a few suggestions from Bob later, I'm now converting the test program I wrote to work as a function/package that can be used within my app. I shall detail more about that in a guest blog post on the [pybit.es](https://pybit.es) website coming soon.  

I will do some follow up posts on the things I've learned so that you can follow along with what I've done, it'll just take some time to catch up with the code and articles on the choices I made. 
  
Hopefully you're all still following along  with the blog and my progress, but if not I'll continue writing anyway as its a good reference for me to go back and review in the future and see how I'm progressing.

 
You will also notice from the title of this article that I have now reached the end of my PDM journey with pybites. It's been a wonderful experience for me and probably the best training I have undertaken to date. I've met some wonderful people and made some new friends along the way. I will certainly miss the three calls we had each week and will now have to find something to fill the void (more projects / apps hopefully). I cannot recommend this course highly enough, go ahead and check it out for yourselves.
[Pybites Developer Mindset](https://pybitesdevelopermindset.com) Go and have a chat with Bob and Julian, you won't regret it. They are doing some fantastic work in the Python training field. 

I have every intention of continuing the blog past the end of PDM so please keep checking in for updates on my progress.
