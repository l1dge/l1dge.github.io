So this week saw the launch of my github pages blog site, you must know that or you wouldn't be reading this now! But have you noticed the changes I have slowly been making to the site this week? So far we have had excerpts of posts on the home page, tags, and now disus commenting has been added. Along with a comment count below the post titles on the home page. There will be loads more <!--more-->changes in the following weeks once I've got to grips with jekyll and its themeing.

I'm not sure if I like the current theme and I'm considering bootstrapping the site at some point in the future, but for the time being focus will be on PDM.
