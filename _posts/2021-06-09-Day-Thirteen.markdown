Today didn't go as planned. Not by a long way. I had some issues to deal with at the office before I could get into my PDM work today. This took about 6 hours to sort out leaving me not a lot of time to get a PR raised for Bob, at least not as clean as I'd have liked.<!--more--> The refactoring of my app was semi-completed but very untidy (sorry Bob!) I hate doing sloppy work. Tomorrow will be a better day, that is assuming I have no side effects from the second 5G jab I have at 08:30!!  
  
Then I need to knuckle down to write some fake data to populate the database using Faker, and possibly factories, and then I have to write some tests to check everything is working as it should be. There are so many ways to do both of these tasks but you have to start somewhere.  
  
Oh, and I also need to investigate the auth module for Django. Just a small list of TODO's!! Speaking of TODO's I found a neat app [GitHub TODO](https://github.com/jasonetco/todo) to add to github so that it creates an issue when it finds a TODO in your code. Some of you may already know about this but it was new to me, and something I'm going to find very helpful, especially for remembering all those nuggetts of information from Bob!

Anyway I need to hit the hay as I have an early start so, Goodnight Folks, see you tomorrow!
