This morning has been a struggle. I worked hard last week fixing the testing, working with Bob to refactor my use of Coverage to use pytest and pytest-cov and then it all went horribly wrong on Friday when trying to merge branches in github into main. <!--more--> Having recovered from the merging mess by cherrypicking my commits in the github desktop application and fixing all the missing stuff, I left the repo in a good place on Friday night.  
  
Today however, I have just been unable to face looking at my code. Not because I don't know what to do but because I think I'm just having an off day. It happens. I have spent the entirety of today (it's now 15:00 on Monday) procrastinating and doing anything but what I should be doing. I got some non-PDM work done first thing this morning but have since been a bit meh..... It's not that I don't want to do anything, it's just that I can't face it right now.  
  
I didn't write much on Twitter last week or blog posts as I was so busy with my code. Today I just don't feel like it, I mean it's taken me over an hour just to write these few lines for this post, but I'm not worried. Because I know tomorrow I'll be back to my normal self and churning out ~~mistakes~~ good code for Bob to comment on! My belief is its okay to have an offday. Its not a crime and after 5 weeks of flat out intense coding/learning on PDM I think its quite healthy. The fact that I can recognise and acknowledge when I am procrastinating is big leap forward. I know the signs and I know how to correct them (when I want to).  
  
Not everyone will think that way, but your brain does need a rest occaisionally, and when you have a family, it doesn't always get a break at the weekend.

Anyway, [toodle-pip](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=toodle%20pip) (a British colloquialism), see you all tomorrow.
