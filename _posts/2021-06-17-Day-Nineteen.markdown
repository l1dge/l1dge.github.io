So yesterday was a nightmare with regards to my code. I think sometimes when you apply too many "fixes" you sometimes lose sight of the original problem.<!--more-->  
I spent too many hours this week chasing my tail trying to fix an authentication issue. I had a good meeting with Bob for our code-clinic today and at that point I decided to rip out all the existing authentication code in my app and start again. Thankfully [django-allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) came to my rescue and a wonderful video training by Bob also helped.
  
By the time this evening rolled around I had working email sign-up with email verification and enough time to spare to implement some [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) shinyness. My django-commands were also plesantly working by this time too, no more double inserts causing unique key violations!
  
I have to say there were times this week I wondered if I was out of my depth. But no, I wasn't, I hit a wall and had to find a way through. This involved me taking some time away from the code yesterday and doing something else for a while. It helped immensely and I came back refreshed and raring to go this morning. I don't like to be beaten by a problem and sometimes that can be a curse as well as a blessing.
  
If there two pieces of advice I have learned this week, one is "Simple is better than complex".
