After a not so relaxing weekend and Fathers Day it was back to coding yesterday. It still suprises me how you can plan to do one thing and then end up spending a day fixing one small item that you hadn't foreseen. This was how the start of my week went. <!--more-->By the end of the day however I think (I say think as this git stuff is still a black art to me and I'm at the base of the learning curve) all my code changes had been commited and I was getting feedback from Bob which was great. But, and heres the kicker, the code Bob was commenting on seemed to be older versions of my code and I couldn't figure out why. Turns out that whilst I had committed my changes locally I had forgotten to push them remotely. Its a learning process and I'm slowly getting better.  
  
Today I am making a start on some tests for my code and learning about Django testing, somthing I should have done before refacrtoring the authentication within my application!! It could have saved me hours. Hopefully tonights post will have some details about how far I actually got with this.
  
See you in a while.
