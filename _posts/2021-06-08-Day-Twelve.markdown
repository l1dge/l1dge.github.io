Today I got into quite a pickle with my code. This was mainly my own fault as I had over complicated the initial setup (never take shortcuts, you'll always bactrack!). Things that should have been easy to fix and implement soon spiralled out of control and I hit the brakes. <!--more-->I downed tools, sent Bob a message on Slack letting him know what I was about to do and contemplated my next move.  
That move was to completey rewrite the app removing complexities that were not required and refactoring the code to make it more understandable. That took me most of the day and by 7pm this evening (BST) I had a working site again complete with functioning authentication facilities.  
The plan for tomorrow is to continue the refactoring, which shouldn't be a lot as most of that was done today, then get a PR raised on Github and see if my rebuilt app is coded correctly by letting Bob review the code.  
  
All this work was done around todays code clinic Zoom meeting which presented challenges of its own. Zoom decided to shit-the-bed just as I was connecting to the meeting and my webcam failed to register causing no video or sound at my end. One reboot (it's 2021 FFS, why do we still have to reboot to get hardware recognized!!!!!) and ten minutes later I was back into the Zoom. A great presentation by Antonio using Jupyter Notebooks which I will need to rewatch at somepoint. And yes it took ten minutes to reboot as this was my linux server and I had to shutdown all the databases and services before the restart.  
  
"But I thought you had an M1 Mac Mini" I hear you cry, and you would be correct, but I can only drive two monitors off of that and yesterday during my workspace rearranging, that little devil on my shoulder told me I needed a third monitor (I had a spare in the office) and I can only do that with the AMD graphics card in my PC/Linux machine. Maybe I'll do a write up on my office setup one day if people are interested (could be my next YouTube video..)  
As I sit here finishing up this article whilst forcing myself to stay awake, I can still honestly say I am really learning a lot on this PDM programme and still thouroughly enjoying it.  
  
Anyway, Goodnight, thanks for reading, and see you in tomorrows blog post!!
