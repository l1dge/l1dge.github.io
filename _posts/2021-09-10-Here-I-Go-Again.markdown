So I've started a new adventure this week. Now that my programme with PDM has officially ended I wanted to continue the momentum and learn something <!--more-->that has been on my list for a very long time. PDM has given me the confidence to know I can do it, and I'm really looking forward to this next journey.

This week I started the [Machine Learning Zoom Camp](https://datatalks.club/courses/2021-winter-ml-zoomcamp.html) by [Alexey Grigorev](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev).
One week in and my mind is blown already. Lots to learn, and some linear algebra thrown in to boot, not something I ever excelled at when I was at school!

As usual I will be documenting my progress here and letting you know about it via social media.

TIL this week:

* Some Linear algebra
* ML vs Rules
* crisp-dm
* model selection
* numpy and pandas refresher
* How to use jupyter notebooks (very useful)

So thats enough learning for one week, but I'll be continuing with progress on my previous apps. I shall also only be blogging once a week with a summary of what I have learned and any issues I may have encountered. It's too taxing to try and keep blogging, do social media, keep up with the day job and learn everything I need to from this course. But if you are inclined to follow me on social media you can also reach me at the following places:

Signing off for today, Happy Coding, Happy Weekend! See you soon!
