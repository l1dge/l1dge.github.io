Today I spent a lot of the day re-arranging my office workspace. I was already running a two monitor setup but found there just wasn't enough screen real estate to have documentation, <!--more-->terminals, vscode etc all open at the same time and be productive effectively. You can never have too many monitors! or enough office space!!

With that done (still have to do some cable tidying, but then again, don't we all, it's the bane of every techies life!) I progressed to completly changing the authentication system and will finish that off tomorrow. Self registration, forgotten passwords etc ad infinitum.

Yes, there is a tremendous amount to learn, but thats all part of the process isn't it? I love finding out how to implement some of these features and whilst it does involve looking at a fair amount of documentation, it's also fun and enjoyable. Getting in the zone for 5 hours at a time without distraction has been the single most important change I've made in my workflow, aside from the extra monitor.  

Taking a break during the long concentration sessions is important too as is letting people know not to disturb you so you can focus, both of these are an incredibly important part of this strategy. It is taking some adjusting to, both on my part, and for my family.  

But ultimately at the end of the day I can lock the office door, walk the five yard commute home and know I can go back to it again tomorrow.  

And if the wife just happens to fall asleep whilst watching the TV in the evening, I've always got my laptop beside me to hack out another couple of pybites challenges.

Happy Coding! See you guys tomorrow!
