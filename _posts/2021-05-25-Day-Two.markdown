<!--excerpt-start-->Day Two completed. Today was spent modelling the database and tables required for my first project. Created a Python virtualenv, installed Django and created my first django app. Setup my urls/apps and basic views. Created the db using sqlite and commited it all to my github repo. Made the mistake of committing to main rather than creating a <!--excerpt-end-->branch so spent the afternoon wrangling with git to upload everything correctly. Branch has now been commited and my first PR has been raised.

Spent the rest of the afternoon in a great Zoom meeting, first Code-Clinic of many, where I learned some things about Entomology and flask thanks to Luigi and Numba/Cython thanks to Ishan. Both great talks, and interested to try out some of the aspects from both.

Now its 21:00, so writing todays Blog post. One minor niggle for me was I've spent the last 36-37 days on a coding streak doing my #100DaysofCode on the [codechalleng.es](https://codechalleng.es) website, but because of starting PDM and not completeing my challenge, (although I'm coding for PDM) I've broken my coding streak on the calendar. Not a big issue but it was kinda motivational seeing that each day! Guess I'll just have to write my own in Python :-)
