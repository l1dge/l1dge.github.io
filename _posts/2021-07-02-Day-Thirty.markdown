Ending this week on a massive high and not the pill popping kind either!! Managed to get some big progress on the app this week, removing redundant code, streamlining the functions and adding new features. <!--more-->I also managed to catch a huge bug which I need to add a test case for, I also have a big list of activities to complete by the end of next week so that I can continue onto the next app.  
  
Had a great couple of meetings this week with Bob and Julian, both helped me refocus on what is and what isn't important. I'm looking forward to finally being able to demo this to others even if its just for my own peace of mind. 5 weeks ago I didn't have an app or the mindset to build one, now I am on the verge of deploying one for the world to see. That is a huge win in my book. Can't wait to show off the next app at the end of PDM.

Anyway, my dinner is ready and I'm hungry, all that remains to be said is "COME ON ENGLAND!!" looking forward to the football (soccer) this weekend if you couldn't tell!

Tally ho!!
