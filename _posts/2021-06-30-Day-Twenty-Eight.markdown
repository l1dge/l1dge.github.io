Today was a great day, I had a great 1:1 with Julian, discussed a lot of interesting things, PDM and non-PDM related. Discussed the need to have a break every once in a while and how things are going now I've hit the halfway mark on PDM<!--more--> (yes, 5 weeks in already!!). This was midway through the day and came at a convenient point in my coding day. I managed to get a couple of new features added to the app today and only have a few more to go before it is probably useable by end users for some sort of alpha/beta testing. There is still a lot to do cosmetically but it is actually functioning well. 
  
Next I would like to start looking at my proposed second project in parallel which will hopefully be a lot cleaner and faster to start. And I am toying with the ide of a third side project just to make things interesting.  

Well, just a short post tonight, suffice to say things are feeling good again!! See you in the next one.
