Well testing was much easier to setup than I had initially imagined. Using another new package [Coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.5/) it was easy to see what I needed to test, then after a couple of examples it was easy to figure out how to write those tests. My epihany moment came when I actually realised how cool this package is by creating its own database for testing purposes. It made life so much easier. <!--more-->I managed to get two PR's raised for Bob to have a look at, implemented a few recommendations from him and these are reducing so either I'm getting better at coding and making less mistakes üëç or I just haven't made as many changes this week üëé .  
  
I prefer to think it's the former rather than the latter as I feel like I've been writing a lot of code in the last two weeks despite the number of issues I had with the authentication problems last week.  
  
I've also raised a question for this weeks mindset call to try and understand how the other guys and gals on the course make time to read so many amazing books. I think I know the answer and have my own system, but I really struggle to find "time" to read. I spend 8-12 hours a day in front of the PC trying to make progress on my code, and doing my day job, then I cook the dinner for the family (not everynight but some), and then try and have some downtime away from the screen. Two sentences into my next chapter and I start to struggle to maintain that focus. So I'm just curious how y'all manage it! Tell me your secrets...please!  
  
Anyway, time to write some more code. See you in the next episode!
